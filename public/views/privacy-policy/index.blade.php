                                    The purpose of this privacy policy is to give you a clear explanation about how we use the personal information we collect from you when you use one of our websites to find a financial product or service. It is important that you read it in full to understand the information we need to collect from you, how we will use it and how you can access, update and delete your personal information. It should be read together with our Terms and Conditions
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    If you are re-directed to, or click on a link that takes you to a third-party website that is not ours, we will not be responsible for how they use your personal information. You should read their privacy policy to understand how they may use your personal information. Other than the information in section 9 (“Who do we share your personal information with?”), this privacy policy only explains how we will process your personal information.

                                    “Personal information” in this policy means any information that we collect that could identify you such as for e.g. your name, address and online identifiers like your IP address.

                                    When you ask us to search for a financial service or product, we will use the personal information you provide to us in the different ways described below to deliver “Our Service”.
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    We are a data controller in relation to the personal information you have given to us, and we store this in a UK data centre.

                                    We share the personal information you have given to us on your application form with Equifax Limited who are a credit reference agency (“CRA”) to carry out a soft search on you. This enables us to check your identity and creditworthiness (ie how likely it is that you will be able to repay the credit) so that we can assess which lender(s) may be more suitable for your financial circumstances.
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    We then share your personal information with our panel of financial services firms who are authorised to provide the product or service you are looking for, (“Our Partners”). If we cannot find the product or service you are specifically looking for, we may transfer you directly to alternative firms who provide services such as credit builder tools. These could incur a monthly fee if you choose to use them.

                                    Our Partners are separate data controllers when they receive this information, and they may process it for their legitimate interests to see whether they can provide you with the financial service or product you are looking for. For example, if you are enquiring about:

                                    A loan:

                                    Our Partners include our panel of lenders, together with other credit brokers who operate their own panel of lenders and brokers. They will carry out a loan eligibility assessment and make an automated decision about you such as a soft search. (Please see point 10 below for more information about this and what rights you may have as a result).
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    If any of Our Partners are not able to help you, they may need to retain your personal information for a period of time (usually 12 months) so that they can use it to support their legal and regulatory obligations and their legitimate interests such as fraud and credit analysis. This also enables them to match any subsequent applications you might make during this time against the personal information held to ensure they do not credit search you unnecessarily.
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    Where you have been unsuccessful with your initial search for a loan, we may present you with the opportunity to connect your bank or building society account through one of Our Partners to validate your income. This could increase your chance of obtaining a loan as lenders will then be provided with your recent categorised and transactional banking data and so will be better able to assess your creditworthiness. Alternatively, you can choose to proceed with one of Our Partners who provides a different financial product or service that we think may be of interest to you, for example a guarantor loan, debt solution or banking product. If you choose to proceed, we will share your personal information with Our Partner so that they can assess whether or not they can help you.
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    Where you have been successful with your search for a loan, you will either be re-directed immediately to Our Partner’s website to complete your application, or we may present you with offers for products and services that you could be eligible for. If you decide to proceed with any of these offers, you will then be re-directed to Our Partner’s website to complete your application.
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    Our Partner will provide you with the terms and conditions for that loan product. If you decide to complete your application, they will also carry out their own identification and validation checks (including fraud prevention procedures, affordability and credit application checks), in accordance with their own criteria. Any full credit check, (also known as a "hard" search) carried out by any of Our Partners will be visible on your credit file to any other lender in the future.

If you do this, we will share your information with Our Partner, and you will be re-directed to their website to complete your application.

If you are searching for a loan or credit card product, Our Partners comprise a panel of consumer credit lenders, brokers and credit card issuers.
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    If you have been unsuccessful with your search for a loan or credit card, Our Partners comprise financial services firms who (where required), are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority to provide debt solution products, credit broking, credit information services, e-money issuance and payment services and can offer a range of alternative financial products and services including, for example, a range of credit reporting tools.
                                    Broadcasting networks (such as TV and radio stations), media buying and advertising networks, and social media companies (such as Facebook, Google and SnapChat) so that we can present relevant advertisements to you.
                                    CRAs : to help us to improve Our Service, we occasionally share customer personal information with CRAs. They aggregate this information so that no one can be identified. We can then analyse patterns and trends that help us to identify the most appropriate product or service for you and improve our ability to show you relevant adverts at the right time that may be of interest to you.
                                    We also share your information with CRAs to process your application, check your identity and creditworthiness so that we can assess which of Our Partners may be more suitable for your financial circumstances.
                                    For example, we share your personal information with Equifax Limited who are a CRA. As a result, they give us information about you, and anyone you may have a financial association with (e.g. a joint mortgage or joint bank account). Equifax will record a footprint on your credit file that we have requested. This search footprint will be visible only to you and will not affect your credit score.
                                    For more information about how Equifax may use your personal information, you can read the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice here, or you can ask Equifax for a copy. You can also read Equifax’s privacy policy here: https://www.equifax.co.uk/ein.html.
                                    Other companies who enable us to provide Our Service or who provide services to us, for example IT Service Providers (who provide for e.g. technology platforms or other IT services including data storage), and communication providers (who provide for e.g. email and text services for customer contact and marketing purposes) and marketing data analysis providers (who provide for e.g. audience insights and analysis).

                                    These third parties help us to provide Our Service. In order that they can do this, we may need to let them process your personal information. We will make sure that they keep the information secure and in accordance with our instructions, the UK General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (“UK GDPR”) and other UK privacy legislation.
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">

Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal information in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.

                                    An automated decision is one where a computer or system is used to assess the information you provide to make a decision about you. We do not make automated decisions about you however, Our Partners may do this when we share your personal information with them so that they can make an assessment of your eligibility for Our Service. An example of this is the soft search that Our Partners will carry out upon you if you make an application for a loan or credit card with them.
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    (Note: a “soft” credit search helps Our Partner to decide whether or not they may be able to lend money to you. Unlike a “hard” credit search, a soft search is recorded on your credit file, but only you rather than any other lender will be able to see it. A soft search does not therefore affect your credit rating.)
                                </p><p class="lead subtitle">
                                    As a result, you have the right to ask Our Partners that they do not make a final decision based solely on automated means. You can also object to the automated decision and ask that a person reviews it. If you ask us, we can tell you which of Our Partners has made an automated decision about you. To exercise this right, you will then need to contact Our Partners directly.

We will action any request you make promptly, although this will mean that we will not be able to help you find the financial product or service that you asked us to search for.
                                    Right of Access - you can ask us at any time to confirm whether we hold your personal information, and if so you can access it by writing to us at: Data Subject Access Request Department, Stag Finance Limited, 71-75 Shelton Steet, London, UK, WC2H 9QJ or by sending us an email.

                                    Right to erasure - if it is no longer necessary for us to hold your personal information bearing in mind the reason why you provided it to us, you can ask us to delete it. If you ask us to do this, we will delete your personal information as soon as possible although this will mean that we may not be able to help you find the financial product or service that you asked us to search for.
                                    Right to restrict our use of your information - you can ask us to restrict our processing of your personal information if you think for example that the personal information you gave us is inaccurate. This may mean that we may not be able to help you find the financial product or service that you asked us to search for.
                                    Right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) - we will try to resolve any complaint that you may have in relation to data protection issues. If you are not happy with our final response you have the right to have your complaint dealt with by the ICO. See section 14 - “Complaints and contact details of our data protection officer.”

                                    Although we do not routinely transfer personal information outside the UK, we may sometimes need to do this where any of Our Partners or third-party suppliers are either based outside the EEA, or where they use data processors based outside the EEA. Where this is the case, we will make sure that they agree to: keep your personal information secure; apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to information held in the UK, and to use it only for the purpose of providing Our Service. We will do this by putting in place appropriate safeguards and protections as stated under UK law, for example using a data-transfer agreement incorporating certain standard model protection clauses.

In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

                                    accept a lender’s loan offer, they may perform a hard credit search to register

                                search on your credit file to assess your eligibility for the product you are applying
                                for. Soft searches are only visible to you and do not affect your credit rating. Should
                                you elect to move forward with a loan product, the lender may then convert the soft
                                search into a hard search which will be visible to other credit providers and yourself.
                                A hard search can negatively impact your credit score</div>
